# sewing-app
It is a vue-based single page application that allows users to generate, customize and download sewing patters based on their resume through the use of FreeSewing API.

This is my first vue project and I'm following tutorial from https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/real-world-vue-3-composition-api/create-vue-creating-the-project to learn about vue framework.
